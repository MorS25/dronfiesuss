This is a node project to manage drones operations correctly.



## Steps to run this project:
To run the project you need install dependencies with `npm install` and you need to have a **postgis** database. The parameters of connection are located on **ormconfig.json**. To simplify the process you can use **docker-compose**. With `docker-compose up` will start the containers. Only the first time you will need cerate the test and install the postgis extension database running the script `docker-compose run postgres bash /scripts/test_database.bash` (it's important that the docker containers are running to run this command). Finally to start the app type `npm start`

``` shell
npm install #only first time

docker-compose run postgres bash /scripts/test_database.bash #only first time
npm start
```
