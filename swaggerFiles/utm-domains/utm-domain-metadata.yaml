  EventMetadata:
    type: object

      - data_collection
      - scenario
      - test_card
      - call_sign
      - test_type

    properties:
      data_collection:
        description: >-
          If true these data are intended for Data Collection. Essentially
          stating if particular data should be ignored during analysis. This
          may be modified after submission in the case that there was an issue
          during execution of the test/experiment that would invalidate the
          data that were collected.
        type: boolean
      event_id:
        type: string
        description: >-
          A string tag indicating which event this operation is associated.
          Will be used to select a set of rules for validation.
        minLength: 1
        maxLength: 100
      scenario:
        description: >-
          Proper formatting for SOW scenarios is "SCENARIO_n" where n is 1-5.

          For other scenarios, the appropriate value should be provided by the
          POC for that activity.
        type: string
        minLength: 1
        maxLength: 100
      test_card:
        description: >-
          The name or number of the test card.  In many cases, a scenario will
          have only one test_card, but it is possible that there are multiple
          test_cards for a given scenario.
        minLength: 1
        maxLength: 100
        type: string
      test_run:
        description: >-
          An identifier for a specific run of a test_card.  In many cases, a
          test_card may be only run once.  However, it is possible that a
          test_card is run multiple times.
        minLength: 1
        maxLength: 100
        type: string
      call_sign:
        type: string
        minLength: 1
        maxLength: 100
        description: >-
          Expected values: a call sign, test card role, or flight ID that links
          this operation to a particular test card flight. As an example, in our
          TCL2 demo, "GCS3" could have been used here. For multiple flights
          emanating from one location on a test card, this data element could
          include further information to link the operation to the test card
          flight, such as GCS1A.

          Every operation requires a call_sign that is pre-determined in the
          full test card description.
      test_type:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Test type. Note a GROUND test may use a physical vehicle and a FLIGHT
          test may use a simulated vehicle.  This is the reason for separating
          test_type from source.
        enum:
          - GROUND
          - FLIGHT
      source:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Hardware-in-the-loop (HWITL) flights refer to ground or airborne
          flights. Software-in-the loop (SWITL) flights would be used to tag
          flights do not use a physical vehicle, whether or not there is a
          full-featured simulation involved.
        enum:
          - HWITL
          - SWITL
      location:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Name of the testing location, such as NV, Moffett, Crows
          Landing, etc.  The supplier of the metadata should use a constant
          value for this field when the same location is used mulitple times
          across data submissions. E.g. "AMES" should always be "AMES" and not
          "ames" or "Ames" or "NASA Ames" at other various times.
        minLength: 1
        maxLength: 100
      setting:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Test setting. Note that a LAB setting may involve HWITL source and
          FIELD settings may involve SWITL sources.  LAB settings may have
          GROUND or FLIGHT tests, same with FIELD settings.
        enum:
          - LAB
          - FIELD
      free_text:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Free text may be included with the original submission and/or added
          by a data_quality_engineer.  In the latter case, all previous
          free_text should be preserved, i.e. the data_quality_engineer should
          only append to the free_text field.
        maxLength: 3000
      data_quality_engineer:
        type: string
        format: email_address
        description: >-
          Email address of author handling data quality issue. If multiple
          individuals modify this metadata, this field will only hold the
          last such individual.  In that case, the engineer should make an
          effort to document as much as possible in the free_text field.

          SHOULD NOT be included wth an operation.  This element is populated
          by NASA as needed.
        maxLength: 150
      modified:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          This metadata was modified from its original submission by a
          data_quality_engineer.

          SHOULD NOT be included wth an operation.  This element is populated
          by NASA as needed.
