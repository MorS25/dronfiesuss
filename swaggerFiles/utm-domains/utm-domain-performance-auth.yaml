    The following definition is from:

    FAA NextGen UTM Concept of Operations v1.0

    https://utm.arc.nasa.gov/docs/2018-UTM-ConOps-v1.0.pdf

    NOTE: THIS IS A CONCEPTUAL DEFINITION. IT IS NOT CURRENT POLICY NOR A CURRENT RULE.

    'All BVLOS Operators are required to obtain a Performance Authorization from the FAA prior to
    conducting a UTM operation. A Performance Authorization is a FAA regulatory approval for BVLOS
    Operators to perform a specific type of operation in a specified geographical area. The FAA grants a
    Performance Authorization when a UAS Operatorâ€™s proposed ground and air assets are sufficient to
    meet an established level of performance in the airspace in which they intend to operate.'
